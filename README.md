# Women's March Twitter Analysis
Data science project analyzing Women's March tweets on twitter and scores given by folks over in [Status Of Women](https://statusofwomendata.org/)

## The Problem
#### Introduction and Motivation  
<ul>
    <li> The overall goal of the project is to analyze the tweets with the hashtag #WomensMarch to see if trends occur with the more common issues that face women and the locations of the people tweeting. The motivation of this project is to see which clusters in areas tweet about the most issues in an attempt to find where the most help could possibly be needed. We are going to use webscraping and the Twitter API to gain our information and use linear regression and kmeans to analyze and compile the data.</li>
    <li> The datasets we will use will be the Twitter API for tweets about issues surrounding women using the hashtag #WomensMarch which was used for the event earlier this year. We will also use [Status Of Women](https://statusofwomendata.org/), a website run by the Institute for Women's Policy Research to gain data for each state’s score on women’s issues. We will use webscraping techniques to gain this information and store it in a CSV for further use.</li>
